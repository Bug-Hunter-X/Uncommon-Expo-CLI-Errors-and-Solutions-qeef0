The solution depends on the specific error. Common approaches include:

1. **Check Expo SDK Version:** Ensure your Expo SDK version supports the feature you're using. Update Expo if needed using `expo upgrade`.
2. **Verify Native Module Installation:** If using a native module, double-check if it's correctly installed and linked. Follow the module's specific installation instructions.
3. **Examine Package.json:** Check your `package.json` for any dependency conflicts or missing dependencies that may cause compatibility problems.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild resolves unexpected errors. Try `expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo start`.
5. **Check Expo CLI version:** Make sure you have the latest version of Expo CLI installed: `npm install -g expo-cli`
6. **Consult Expo Documentation:** Refer to the official Expo documentation for detailed information about the feature you're using and potential troubleshooting steps.
7. **Check for Community Support:** Search online forums and communities (e.g., Stack Overflow, Expo forums) for similar errors. You may find a solution or helpful suggestions.
